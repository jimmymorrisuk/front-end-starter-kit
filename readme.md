Gulp Front end starter kit
=======

A starter kit to bootstrap project's front ends. It's designed to be lightweight to be reusable, but also contains some non project specific highly used code (unlike Twitter BS) to give you a boost at the start. 

There are two main purposes to this kit. One is to create a general workflow managed by Gulp to automate tasks. The other is to provide a project bootstrap to speed up starting a project in ensure conventions are followed (of course these can be removed to suit).

What is included
-----------

**Workflow tasks (via `gulp` command):**
 * Static file server via [localhost](http://localhost:3000)
 * Live reload of file changes
 * SASS to CSS compilation
 * CSS browser prefixes
 * Minified CSS and JS (renamed to include .min)
 * CSS and JS source maps
 * Image opimisation (runs only on new/changed files)

**Project bootstrapping:**
 * TODO

Getting started
-----------

 **Machine set up**
 If you don't have the following already.

 * Install node for on your machine: [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)
 * Install Gulp globally: `sudo npm install --global gulp`

 **Using this on a project**
 
 * Clone this repo to start a new project and name it
 * Get npm to install the project dependencies `npm install`
 * When ready run `gulp` any you are away, the server will start

The workflow
-----------

You add your file and make edit inside of the `app/src` folder this is your working environment. The `app/dist` folder is your production code designed to be efficient for the browser, although it will come with source maps.

**Simple flow**
Make human friendly code in `app/src` -> see browser friendly output in `app/dis` for use in the production enviroment.

Troubleshooting
-----------

**npm EACCESS - error**

Quite often you can have issues with npm and access permissions. First try running the command with `sudo` or `sudo !!` to run the last command as sudo. If that fails try checking the node_module folder has the correct owner and try again.

**Segmentation fault: 11 - error**

I had this error while using Gulp. I am not exactly sure what caused it but agreeing to XCode's license agreement seemed to have solved the issue.
